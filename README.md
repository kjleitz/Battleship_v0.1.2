This is capital-V Very unfinished. A lot of the code is still in a letter-number coordinate system, and deprecated, and I'm moving the code to a number-number coordinate system and reworking the algorithms because I was an idiot who thought it would be just as easy to use letter-number and stubbornly stuck with it for a while. It is not yet a game, halfway between two competing coordinate systems, poorly coded, and poorly commented. Beware.
